# HousingProject
This is created for Coursera Final Project. 
This project aims to evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model trained on the Boston Housing Dataset. The goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the median value of owner-occupied homes in various suburbs of Boston based on 13 socioeconomic and environmental features.
By analyzing factors such as crime rates, number of rooms, and proximity to employment centers, this project explores the relationships between different urban features and property values.
